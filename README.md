# Alexa-to-detect-Covid-19-using_CNN

**Alexa-to-detect-Covid-19-using_CNN** integrates speech synthesis with a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to assist in early COVID-19 detection.This research explores the integration of AI, medical imaging, and voice technology for hands-free, user-friendly COVID-19 detection. It investigates the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) combined with text-to-speech technologies like pyttsx3 and gTTS in analyzing chest X-ray images and providing spoken diagnostic insights.

## üèÜ Key Features  
- Voice-Activated Diagnosis: Uses **pyttsx3** and **gTTS** for text-to-speech conversion.  
- Deep Learning Analysis: A CNN model analyzes chest X-ray images for COVID-19 detection.    
- AI-Powered Insights: The model provides fast and accurate predictions.  

## üöÄ How It Works  
Image Upload: The user uploads a chest X-ray image.
Image Analysis: A CNN model processes the image and classifies it as COVID-19 positive or negative.
Voice Response Generation: The system converts the result into speech using pyttsx3 (offline) and gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech).
Precautionary Advice: If the result is positive, the system provides recommended precautions based on health guidelines.
Latest COVID-19 News: The system fetches and reads out recent updates on COVID-19 to keep users informed.
